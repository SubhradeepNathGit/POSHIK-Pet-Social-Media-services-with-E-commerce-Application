# Dashboard Restructure - Admin, User, and Vet Modules

## Overview
The project has been successfully restructured into three separate modules with dedicated routing and layouts for better organization and maintainability.

## New Folder Structure

```
src/app/
├── modules/
│   ├── admin/
│   │   ├── layout.tsx          # Admin-specific layout with auth & sidebar
│   │   └── page.tsx            # Admin dashboard with KYC management
│   ├── user/
│   │   ├── layout.tsx          # User-specific layout with auth & sidebar
│   │   └── page.tsx            # User dashboard with pet management
│   └── vet/
│       ├── layout.tsx          # Vet-specific layout with auth & sidebar
│       ├── page.tsx            # Vet dashboard with appointment management
│       └── kyc-pending/
│           └── page.tsx        # KYC pending status page for vets
├── dashboard/
│   └── page.tsx                # Redirect component based on user role
└── config/
    └── sidebarMenus.ts         # Updated with new module routes
```

## Key Features

### 1. Role-Based Routing
- `/dashboard` - Automatically redirects users to their appropriate module
- `/modules/admin` - Admin dashboard with KYC management
- `/modules/user` - User dashboard with pet profiles and features
- `/modules/vet` - Vet dashboard with appointment management
- `/modules/vet/kyc-pending` - KYC pending status for vets

### 2. Authentication & Authorization
Each module layout includes:
- User authentication checks
- Role-based access control
- Automatic redirection to appropriate modules
- KYC status validation for vets

### 3. Module-Specific Features

#### Admin Module
- KYC review and approval system
- User statistics and metrics
- Veterinarian management
- Document viewing capabilities

#### User Module
- Pet profile management
- Feature cards for main actions
- Pet photo gallery modal
- Appointment booking access

#### Vet Module
- Appointment management
- Patient information display
- Status filtering (pending, accepted, rejected)
- KYC status handling

### 4. Updated Sidebar Navigation
- Role-specific menu items
- Updated paths to point to new modules
- Consistent navigation across all modules

## Migration Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Each role has its own dedicated space
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Easier to modify role-specific features
3. **Enhanced Security**: Role-based access control at the layout level
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new features to specific modules
5. **Code Reusability**: Shared components can be easily imported

## Usage

Users will now be automatically redirected to their appropriate dashboard based on their role:
- **Admins** → `/modules/admin`
- **Users** → `/modules/user`  
- **Vets** → `/modules/vet` (or `/modules/vet/kyc-pending` if not approved)

The old monolithic dashboard has been replaced with a simple redirect component that determines the user's role and sends them to the appropriate module.

## Next Steps

1. Test all routes to ensure proper redirection
2. Update any remaining hardcoded dashboard paths
3. Consider adding module-specific error boundaries
4. Add loading states for better UX during role checks
